Important note on React Native apps
React native apps can very well be automated with Appium.

React native apps are native apps, not hybrid apps. The Sauce Lab demo app used in this course is a React Native app.

If you are automating a React Native app and cannot find UI elements uniquely, then ask your developer to add a "testID" attribute for each UI element. This attribute is mapped to resource-id (or content-desc) in the case of Android and accessibility-identifier (or label) in the case of iOS.

Devs might be hesitant to add an "accessibilityLabel" attribute because it can create problems with accessibility reader tools.

With "testID," this problem can be avoided.

You can even have both "accessibilityLabel" and "testID" set if your developer agrees to this.

If you get this done, you will not need XPath in most cases, and your life will become easy. Trust me on this.
